										<h3>By Deena Beasley and Nick Brown</h3>
										<p>
											In the six months since an entirely new coronavirus began spreading around the world, doctors and hospitals have learned a lot about how to treat patients with COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the virus.

											What doctors have learned about fighting COVID-19:
											
											* Patients are at increased risk of blood clots, and blood thinning agents can help.
											
											* "Proning" - putting patients on their stomachs to relieve pressure on the lungs - can stave off the need for mechanical ventilation.
											
											* Besides the respiratory system and lungs, the coronavirus can attack many other organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain.

										<h3>@seemathewombat says:</h3>
										<p>
											A tweet from a doctor in Australia, “I’m a Dr. I’m about to separate from my family within my home for ?? months. So that I can keeping treating you, whilst trying to keep my family safe. It hurts. No hugs from my girls, no cuddles from my partner. PLS socially distance NOW, to make my sacrifice worth it.”

									        While such precautions for doctors are still in the planning stages in India, we asked medical professionals what goes through their minds when a pandemic is declared and they are at the forefront of testing and caring. How do their partners react?
